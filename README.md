# portfolio-challenge

This is a portfolio template to show projects that I have worked on. It includes a navigation bar, linking to sections on the page, a short about section, a gird showing projects and a contact bar with links. It is designed to respond to diffrerent size windows, adopting a one-column layout for any window narrower than 800px.
